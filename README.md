# Purpose GAN-implementation
 Generate fake faces
 
 # Applications
 1. Marketing - fake faces can be used on billboards for advertising purpose which can save a lot of capital
 2. It can help people test face-blindness
 3. Journalists can protect identities
 4. Enterprise companies can use these faces to demo their software to customers. Gaming companies can use to generate profiles
 5. These fake faces are also used for exhibitions.
 6. So far, anonymity and creative productions have been the most popular draws, but the application range is quite broad.

 
# About project
We are defining and training a DCGAN on a dataset of celebrity faces in this project. Our goal is to use a network of generators and discriminators to create new images of faces that look as real as possible but aren't real or don't exist!

The project is divided into several steps, starting with data loading, pre-processing, and defining and training adversarial networks. We will be able to visualize the results of our trained Generator at the end of the project to see how it performs; our generated samples will appear to be fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
